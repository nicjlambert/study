### Question 1

When a workspace is deleted, it can be restored up to a certain number of days. This is known as the retention period. What is the default and maximum retention period?

1. 0, 30
2. 7, 30
3. 7, 45
4. 14, 120
5. 7, 90 <-- **ANS**

The retention period for collaborative workspaces is configurable. The default retention period is seven days. However, Fabric administrators can change the length of the retention period by turning on the Define workspace retention period setting in the admin portal and specifying the desired retention period (from 7 to 90 days).
